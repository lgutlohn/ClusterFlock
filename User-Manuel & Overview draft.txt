User Manuel:

When launching the application you will be presented with a login page where you log in
After logging in the main page will appear where on the right side you can enter a twitter username
click out of the dialouge box and the two most recent tweets from that user will apear below that same box
The nouns will be highlighted and those can be dragged into the new cluster form (or an already existing cluster if there is one)
If dragged into a new cluster form you will be prompted with the new name and description of the cluster to be created
You can then click upon one of the clusters to see all its contents
	i.e. 	the nouns placed into the cluster along with who tweeted it
		statistics about how often a particular noun appears

Overview:

This application allows a user (or users) to cluster specific nouns used in tweets
in regard to certain events
Say during the state of the union address by Barak Obama people were to live tweet the event
President Obama may be phrased different ways
	President Obama
	The 44th President of the United States of America
	Barry
And the user wanted to cluster all of these for analysis
A username would be entered and the tweets would appear and could then be clustered together
There could be more than one cluster at a time.
Say one wanted to complie data from the entire address
There could be 	a cluster for Vice President Biden
		a cluster for Speaker Boehner
		a cluster for random congressman interjecting the speech
